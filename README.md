# Implementation-of-Neural-Network

This is a complex program that appears to implement a kind of neural network with a backtracking mechanism. The neural network's structure and weights are read from files, and the network is run layer by layer, both forward and backward, in separate threads and processes.

Here's a detailed explanation:

* The code uses a variety of C++ libraries, including those for file input/output, string manipulation, threading, and inter-process communication.

* It defines several constants and global variables, including a semaphore for thread synchronization and two file descriptors for pipe communication.

* A DataToPass structure is defined to pass information between threads and processes. It includes a three-dimensional vector for the weights of the neural network, a float for a given neuron's activation, and indices and file descriptors for managing the neural network's layers.

* A function transposeMatrix is defined to transpose a given two-dimensional matrix.

* A class NeuralNetworkData is defined to manage the data of the neural network. It includes methods for reading neuron and weight data from files and for printing the network's weights and neuron values.

* A ThreadArgs structure is defined to pass arguments to the threads that will perform the calculations for each neuron. It includes the neural network's weights, a given neuron's value and index, file descriptors for reading and writing to a pipe, and an index for the current layer.

* A function calculate is defined to be run in each thread. It waits for the semaphore to be available, reads a vector of values from a pipe, performs calculations based on the current neuron's value and weights, writes the resulting values to a pipe, and then posts to the semaphore.

* A function childFunction is defined to be run in each child process. It prepares arguments and then uses the execv function to replace the current process image with a new one, effectively creating a new instance of the program.

In the main function:

1. A named pipe is created, the semaphore is initialized, and an unnamed pipe is created.
2. If the current layer is the last one, the function reads neuron values from a pipe, calculates the function values FX for the final layer, forks a new process, and in the child process, writes the FX values to the named pipe.
3. If the current layer is not the last one, the function creates a vector for the neuron values of the next layer and writes it to the pipe.
4. Threads are created to perform the calculations for each neuron of the current layer, and the program waits for all threads to finish.
5. The neuron values for the next layer are read from the pipe.
6. If there are more layers to process, the program creates a new child process to handle the next layer, and then waits for it to finish.
7. In the parent process, the function reads the FX values from the named pipe, prints them, and then writes them to a second named pipe.

In summary, this program implements a kind of neural network in which each layer is processed in parallel by separate threads, and each layer is handled by a separate process. The neuron values for each layer are passed between processes using pipes, and a named pipe is used to pass the final function values back to the parent process. The network is run both forward and backward, and a semaphore is used to synchronize the threads.
